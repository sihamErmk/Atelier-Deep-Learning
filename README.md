Atelier 1 Deep Learning
Objective:
The main goal of this lab is to familiarize yourself with the PyTorch library and to perform both Regression and Multi-Class Classification tasks using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures.

Part One: Regression
In this part, we use a dataset from Kaggle's NYSE data to apply regression techniques:

Dataset: NYSA Stock Data
Steps:
Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand and visualize the dataset.
Establish a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture using PyTorch to handle the regression task.
Use GridSearch from the scikit-learn library to select the best hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, epochs, model architecture).
Visualize two graphs:
Loss vs Epochs
Accuracy vs Epochs
Apply regularization techniques (such as L2 regularization or dropout) and compare the results with the initial model.
Part Two: Multi-Class Classification
For this part, we use a predictive maintenance dataset to apply multi-class classification:

Dataset: Predictive Maintenance Dataset
Steps:
Apply preprocessing techniques (cleaning, standardization/normalization).
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset.
Apply data augmentation techniques to balance the dataset.
Establish a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture using PyTorch to handle the multi-class classification task.
Use GridSearch from scikit-learn to choose the best hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, epochs, etc.).
Visualize two graphs:
Loss vs Epochs
Accuracy vs Epochs
Calculate evaluation metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, etc.) for both training and test datasets.
Apply regularization techniques and compare the results with the initial model.
Tools:
PyTorch for building deep learning models
scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks for execution
GitHub or GitLab for version control and project management
Instructions:
Clone the repository to your local machine or directly use Google Colab/Kaggle.
Follow the steps outlined in Part One and Part Two.
After completing the project, push the code to this GitHub repository.
Update this README file with insights and conclusions from the lab.
